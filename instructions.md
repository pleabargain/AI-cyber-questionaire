instructions

this is a personal cyber security knowledge assessment system that will be used to assess the cyber security knowledge of the user
though the principles apply across every network, this is a personal system that will be used to assess the cyber security knowledge of the user

create a JSON file with the intent to gather questions and answers from the user about their cyber security knowledge and then use the answers to generate a report on their knowledge
The input is then processed by Ollama to generate a report on the user's knowledge with recommendations for improvement


after the JSON file is created, create a python file that will load the JSON file and then use the answers to generate a report on the user's knowledge with recommendations for improvement

use Ollama to generate the report 
URL for Ollama: http://localhost:11434/
"model": "llama3.2",


create  a directory for storing the answers to the questions
create a test answer file with sample answers for EACH question
make sure the code date stamps the answers.json file

prompt user for name

use colored text in the console to clearly indicate question and answer

user answer file will save like this
{NAME}_cyber_security_assessment_{YYYY.MM.DD.SS}.json

create a directory for storing the reports generated by Ollama
report file will save like this

cyber_sec_report_for_{NAME}_{YYYY.MM.DD.SS}.json
process the json file to create a markdown file
cyber_sec_report_for_{NAME}_{YYYY.MM.DD.SS}.md

show the full path for both the answer file and the report file.json and .md


create a readme.md 
update the readme.md with the instructions for the user

create a requirements.txt file
do NOT number the pip packages
